# weather-dashboard

## Description

A simple weather app for a traveler to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan their travel accordingly.

## Issues

- Used Moment.js - displaying GMT and not just the date for some reason.

- I borrowed css from a previous assignment whose layout was similar and it was special CSS to resemble Bootstrap and not Bootstrap. By the time I figured that out it would have been too much trouble for me to troubleshoot and fix. Should have used Bootstrap for the grid from the beginning. This created issues with my column widths not turning out exactly right.
